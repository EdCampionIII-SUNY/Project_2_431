# Installing Winglang
Winglang is built on top of Node js. As sutch node jS needs to be installed to use wing.  

Note: wing requires Node version 20 or later, the version of Node available through apt is older then version 20. so Node js will need to be installed through a diffren method.  
The latesed  verison of node can be downlaoded from https://nodejs.org/en

Once Node js is installed: install wing with the command 
```bash
npm install -g winglang
```
wing should then be installed, test this by running
```bash
wing --version
```
