# Motivations
## WHY?
Developing cloud based applications in the current day tipicaly requires mastery of serveral tachnologies, theese can come in the form of softwhere stacks run on cloud computers, networking setups between VMs and containers and many other tools specific to the platform you are developing for.   
Additinal chellanges the comes with developing traditional could applications can include
- testing and debuging code
- long deployment times / slower itteration cycles
- every cloud platform hinvg their own version of a thing and having a unicue way to interact witht that thing

Wing was created to address theese problems by creating a single unified high level of abstraction allowing the programer to focus on busness logica insted of how this specific cloud envioremt works.  
Wing additioanly includes a set of tools to assist with local debuging and testing.

## Characteristics 
Wing has interaoperabilioty with javascript and code is oftain compiled into it so naturaly it shares many charisitcs with javascript
