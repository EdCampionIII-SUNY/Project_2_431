# Motivations
## WHY?
Developing cloud based applications in the current day tipicaly requires mastery of serveral tachnologies, theese can come in the form of software stacks run on cloud computers, networking setups between VMs and containers and many other tools specific to the platform you are developing for.   
Additional challenges the comes with developing traditional cloud applications can include
- testing and debuging code
- long deployment times / slower iteration cycles
- every cloud platform having their own version of a thing and having a unique way to interact with that thing



Wing was created to address theese problems by creating a single unified high level of abstraction allowing the programmer to focus on buisness logica insted of how this specific cloud environment works.  
Wing additionally includes a set of tools to assist with local debugging and testing.

## Characteristics 
Wing has interaoperability with javascript and code is often compiled into it so naturally it shares many characteristics with javascript
