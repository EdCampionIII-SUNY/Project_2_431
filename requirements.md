- installation of the language, preferably in WSL
- requirements for the installation
- main motivations(why it was created) and characteristics (such as paradigms and typing disciplines) of the language
- main usage of the language, preferably using VS Code, with examples
[need examples for implementing data structures(product and sum types), concurrency, map/reduce/filter, tail recursion, .... ....]
- shortcomings of the (current version of the) language (what is missing from the language)
- their plans for the future of the language
you should use markdown (.md) files, similar to README.md, for any description of the language assigned to you
but, DO NOT PUT EVERYTHING in README.md;
use additional files
