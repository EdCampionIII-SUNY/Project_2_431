# **Shortcomings**

## Limited Community and Ecosystem
Being relatively new, there are fewer libraries, tools, and community support compared to the longstanding languages. However, it is one of the first of its kind in this approach to cloud programming.

## No Code Formatter
Makes updating and maintaining code, especially written by teams of people, a little more cumbersome.

## No Support for Type Parameters
Cannot define flexible data structures or functions for use with multiple types directly.

## Maturity and Stability
As a young language, there is risk of performance and stability issues.

## No Full Type Interface
Improper handling of optional types and errors in situations like string interpolation.

## Lack of Robust Access Control
Does not work well for complex, functional-style code where resources are passed as parameters. This leads to runtime failures when trying to deploy said applications.
